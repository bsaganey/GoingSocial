Now, this is a story all about how <br>
My life got flipped-turned upside down <br>
And I'd like to take a minute <br>
Just sit right there <br>
I'll tell you how I became the prince of a town called {{ myuser.hometown }} <br>
 <br> <br>
In west (insert city) born and raised <br>
On the playground was where I spent most of my days <br>
Chillin' out maxin' relaxin' all cool <br>
And all shootin some b-ball outside of the school <br>
When a couple of guys who were up to no good <br>
Started making trouble in my neighborhood <br>
I got in one little fight and my mom got scared <br>
She said 'You're movin' with your auntie and uncle in {{ myuser.hometown }}' <br>
 <br> <br>
I whistled for a cab and when it came near <br>
The license plate said fresh and it had dice in the mirror <br>
If anything I could say that this cab was rare <br>
But I thought 'Nah, forget it' - 'Yo, homes to {{ myuser.hometown }}' <br>
 <br> <br>
I pulled up to the house about 7 or 8 <br>
And I yelled to the cabbie 'Yo homes smell ya later' <br>
I looked at my kingdom <br>
I was finally there <br>
To sit on my throne as the Prince of {{ myuser.hometown }} <br>
